# Stock-Price-Prediction

A Machine Learning Model that compares the actual price AAPL (Apple) stock with the model-predicted price.
Dataset collected from Kaggle. Link - https://www.kaggle.com/code/matthiasfoyer/apple-stock-prediction/data.
Used Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) which is a RNN that feeds output of one layer into the input of another layer to train and test the data.
Libraries and APIs used - Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, Keras Libraries.

Used 50 DMA plot in graph and ran the code for 100 epochs to minimise the loss.
Optimisers used are the Adam (Combination of Exponentially Weighted Average(Momentum) and the Root Mean Square (RMSP) and Loss function used is Root Mean Square.
